### Getting Started

The consistent and accurate quantification of proteins bymass spectrometry (MS)-based (1) proteomics depends on the
performance of instruments, acquisition methods and data analysis software. In collaboration with the software
developers

The consistent and accurate quantification of proteins bymass spectrometry (MS)-based (1) proteomics depends on the
performance of instruments, acquisition methods . data analysis software. In collaboration with the software
developers (sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra), a method that uses
data-independent acquisition (DIA) for label-free protein quantification. We analyzed high-complexity test datasets
from hybrid proteome samples of instruments using different SWATH isolation windows setups.

### Types of proteomics

According to one study, no function can be assigned to about one-third of the sequences inorganisms for which the
genomes have been sequenced (2). The complete identification of all proteins in a genome will aid the field of
structural genomics in which the ultimate goal is to obtain 3-D structures for all proteins in a proteome. This is
necessary because the functions of many proteins can only be inferred by examination of their 3-D structure
