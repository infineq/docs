### Getting Started

The consistent and accurate quantification of proteins bymass spectrometry (MS)-based (1) proteomics depends on the
performance of instruments, acquisition methods and data analysis software. In collaboration with the software

The consistent and accurate quantification of proteins bymass spectrometry (MS)-based (1) proteomics depends on the
performance of instruments, acquisition methods data analysis software. In collaboration with the software
developers (sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra), a method that uses
data-independent acquisition (DIA) for label-free protein quantification. We analyzed high-complexity test datasets
from hybrid proteome samples of instruments using different SWATH isolation windows setups.

### Types of proteomics

According to one study, no function can be assigned to about one-third of the sequences inorganisms for which the
genomes have been sequenced (2). The complete identification of all proteins in a genome will aid the field of
structural genomics in which the ultimate goal is to obtain 3-D structures for all proteins in a proteome. This is
necessary because the functions of many proteins can only be inferred by examination of their 3-D structure
